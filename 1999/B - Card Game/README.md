The rules of the game are as follows:</p><ul> <li> Each card has an integer value between $$$1$$$ and $$$10$$$. </li><li> Each player receives $$$2$$$ cards which are face-down (so a player doesn't know their cards). </li><li> The game is turn-based and consists <span class="tex-font-style-bf">exactly of two turns</span>. In a round, both players pick a <span class="tex-font-style-bf">random unflipped</span> card and flip it. The player who flipped a card with a strictly greater number wins the round. In case of equality, no one wins the round. </li><li> A player wins a game if he wins the most number of rounds (i.e. strictly greater than the other player). In case of equality, no one wins the game. </li></ul><p>Since Suneet and Slavic aren't best friends, you need to calculate the number of ways the game could happen that Suneet would end up as the winner.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-it">For a better understanding, please check the notes section.</span></p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The first and only line of each test case contains $$$4$$$ integers $$$a_1$$$, $$$a_2$$$, $$$b_1$$$, $$$b_2$$$ ($$$1 \leq a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2 \leq 10$$$) where $$$a_1$$$ and $$$a_2$$$ represent the cards Suneet has, and $$$b_1$$$ and $$$b_2$$$ represent the cards Slavic has, respectively.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case, output a single integer — the number of games Suneet would win considering all possible games.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id005783479645950319" id="id008521037470679349" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id005783479645950319"><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-0">5</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-1">3 8 2 6</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-2">1 1 1 1</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-3">10 10 2 2</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-4">1 1 10 10</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-5">3 8 7 2</div></pre></div><div class="output"><div class="title">Output<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id006444071432817879" id="id007090743534818075" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id006444071432817879">2
