The easy version differs from the hard one in that it requires determining the minimum cost with the least number of deals, while the hard version requires determining the minimum cost with a limited number of deals.</span></p><p>After the cunning seller sold three watermelons instead of one, he decided to increase his profit — namely, he bought even more watermelons. Now he can sell $$$3^x$$$ watermelons for $$$3^{x+1} + x \cdot 3^{x-1}$$$ coins, where $$$x$$$ is a non-negative integer. Such a sale is called a deal.</p><p>A calculating buyer came to him, but he has critically little time. Because of this, he wants to buy exactly $$$n$$$ watermelons, making the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">least</span> possible number of deals.</p><p>The buyer is in a hurry and has therefore turned to you to determine the minimum number of coins he must pay the seller for $$$n$$$ watermelons, considering that he will make the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">least</span> possible number of deals.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le 10^4)$$$ — the number of test cases.

If we make $$$3$$$ deals, we can get $$$3$$$, $$$5$$$, $$$7$$$, or $$$9$$$ watermelons. If we make fewer than $$$3$$$ deals, we will get no more than $$$6$$$ watermelons, which means it is impossible to buy $$$8$$$ watermelons for less than $$$4$$$ deals.</p></div>
