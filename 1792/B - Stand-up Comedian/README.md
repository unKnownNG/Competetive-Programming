Her first show gathered a grand total of two spectators: Alice and Bob.</p><p>Eve prepared $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4$$$ jokes to tell, grouped by their type: </p><ul> <li> type 1: both Alice and Bob like them; </li><li> type 2: Alice likes them, but Bob doesn't; </li><li> type 3: Bob likes them, but Alice doesn't; </li><li> type 4: neither Alice nor Bob likes them. </li></ul><p>Initially, both spectators have their mood equal to $$$0$$$. When a spectator hears a joke he/she likes, his/her mood increases by $$$1$$$. When a spectator hears a joke he/she doesn't like, his/her mood decreases by $$$1$$$. If the mood of a spectator becomes negative (strictly below zero), he/she leaves.</p><p>When someone leaves, Eve gets sad and ends the show. If no one leaves, and Eve is out of jokes, she also ends the show.</p><p>Thus, Eve wants to arrange her jokes in such a way that the show lasts as long as possible. Help her to calculate the maximum number of jokes she can tell before the show ends.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of testcases.</p><p>The only line of each testcase contains four integers $$$a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$$$ ($$$0 \le a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \le 10^8$$$; $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 \ge 1$$$) — the number of jokes of each type Eve prepared.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum number of jokes Eve can tell before at least one of the spectators leaves or before she runs out of jokes.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id002247080547257101" id="id0024325617127077093" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id002247080547257101"><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-0">4</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-1">5 0 0 0</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-2">0 0 0 5</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-3">2 5 10 6</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-4">3 0 0 7</div></pre></div><div class="output"><div class="title">Output<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id008255638874113238" id="id008112551135422024" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id008255638874113238">5

She tells all her jokes, both Alice and Bob like them. Their mood becomes $$$5$$$. The show ends after Eve runs out of jokes.</p><p>In the second testcase, Eve only has jokes of the fourth type. Thus, once again no order to choose. She tells a joke, and neither Alice, nor Bob likes it. Their mood decrease by one, becoming $$$-1$$$. They both have negative mood, thus, both leave, and the show ends.</p><p>In the third testcase, first, Eve tells both jokes of the first type. Both Alice and Bob has mood $$$2$$$. Then she can tell $$$2$$$ jokes of the third type. Alice's mood becomes $$$0$$$. Bob's mood becomes $$$4$$$. Then $$$4$$$ jokes of the second type. Alice's mood becomes $$$4$$$. Bob's mood becomes $$$0$$$. Then another $$$4$$$ jokes of the third type. Alice's mood becomes $$$0$$$. Bob's mood becomes $$$4$$$. Then the remaining joke of the second type. Alice's mood becomes $$$1$$$. Bob's mood becomes $$$3$$$. Then one more joke of the third type, and a joke of the fourth type, for example. Alice's mood becomes $$$-1$$$, she leaves, and the show ends. </p><p>In the fourth testcase, Eve should first tell the jokes both spectators like, then the jokes they don't. She can tell $$$4$$$ jokes of the fourth type until the spectators leave.</p></div>
