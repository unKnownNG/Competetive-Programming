Of course, there are some moments when you just want to chill and spam something.</p><p>More precisely, you want to spam the emote triangle of size $$$k$$$. It consists of $$$2k-1$$$ messages. The first message consists of one emote, the second one — of two emotes, ..., the $$$k$$$-th one — of $$$k$$$ emotes, the $$$k+1$$$-th one — of $$$k-1$$$ emotes, ..., and the last one — of one emote.</p><p>For example, the emote triangle for $$$k=3$$$ consists of $$$5$$$ messages:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/0a910e5b3823e020640804bc9388e980f7232972.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Of course, most of the channels have auto moderation. Auto moderator of the current chat will ban you right after you spam at least $$$x$$$ emotes in succession (you can assume you are the only user in the chat). Now you are interested — how many messages will you write before getting banned? Or maybe you will not get banned at all (i.e. will write all $$$2k-1$$$ messages and complete your emote triangle successfully)? Note that if you get banned as a result of writing a message, this message is also counted.</p><p>You have to answer $$$t$$$ independent test cases.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The next $$$t$$$ lines describe test cases.</p><p>The only line of the test case contains integers $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le 10^9; 1 \le x \le 10^{18}$$$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case, print the number of messages you will write before getting banned for the corresponding values $$$k$$$ and $$$x$$$.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id006590006805874449" id="id005766608970879629" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id006590006805874449">7

It doesn't get you banned, since $$$1 < 2$$$, but you have already finished posting your emote triangle. So you wrote one message successfully. </li><li> In the fourth test case, you write four messages containing $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$2$$$ emotes respectively, and since $$$1 + 2 + 3 + 2 \ge 7$$$, you get banned after that. </li><li> In the fifth test case, you write three messages containing $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$1$$$ emote respectively. It doesn't get you banned, since $$$1 + 2 + 1 < 5$$$, but you have already finished posting your emote triangle. So you wrote three messages successfully. </li><li> In the sixth test case, since $$$x = 1$$$, you get banned as soon as you send your first message. </li><li> The seventh test case is too large to analyze, so we'll skip it. </li></ol></div>
