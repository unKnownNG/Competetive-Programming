There are $$$n$$$ marbles, the $$$i$$$-th of them has color $$$c_i$$$. The players take turns; Alice goes first, then Bob, then Alice again, then Bob again, and so on.</p><p>During their turn, a player <span class="tex-font-style-bf">must</span> take <span class="tex-font-style-bf">one</span> of the remaining marbles and remove it from the game. If there are no marbles left (all $$$n$$$ marbles have been taken), the game ends.</p><p>Alice's score at the end of the game is calculated as follows:</p><ul> <li> she receives $$$1$$$ point for every color $$$x$$$ such that she has taken at least one marble of that color; </li><li> additionally, she receives $$$1$$$ point for every color $$$x$$$ such that she has taken <span class="tex-font-style-bf">all</span> marbles of that color (of course, only colors present in the game are considered). </li></ul><p>For example, suppose there are $$$5$$$ marbles, their colors are $$$[1, 3, 1, 3, 4]$$$, and the game goes as follows: Alice takes the $$$1$$$-st marble, then Bob takes the $$$3$$$-rd marble, then Alice takes the $$$5$$$-th marble, then Bob takes the $$$2$$$-nd marble, and finally, Alice takes the $$$4$$$-th marble. Then, Alice receives $$$4$$$ points: $$$3$$$ points for having at least one marble for colors $$$1$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, and $$$1$$$ point for having all marbles of color $$$4$$$. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">Note that this strategy is not necessarily optimal for both players</span>.</p><p>Alice wants to maximize her score at the end of the game. Bob wants to minimize it. Both players play optimally (i. e. Alice chooses a strategy which allows her to get as many points as possible, and Bob chooses a strategy which minimizes the amount of points Alice can get).</p><p>Calculate Alice's score at the end of the game.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test case consists of two lines:</p><ul> <li> the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 1000$$$) — the number of marbles; </li><li> the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \le c_i \le n$$$) — the colors of the marbles. </li></ul><p>Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case, print one integer — Alice's score at the end of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id004797138168236703" id="id0021537919650242543" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id004797138168236703"><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-0">3</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-1">5</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-1">1 3 1 3 4</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-2">3</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-even test-example-line-2">1 2 3</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-3">4</div><div class="test-example-line test-example-line-odd test-example-line-3">4 4 4 4</div></pre></div><div class="output"><div class="title">Output<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id009735855706118212" id="id00843187463361951" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id009735855706118212">4
