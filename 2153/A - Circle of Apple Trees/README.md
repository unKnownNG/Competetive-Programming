Each tree bears exactly one apple, and the beauty of the apple on the $$$i$$$-th tree is given by $$$b_i$$$ for all $$$1\le i\le n$$$. You start in front of tree $$$1$$$. </p><p>At each tree, you may choose to either eat the apple or skip it. After making your choice, you move to the next tree: from tree $$$i$$$, you move to tree $$$i+1$$$ for $$$1 \le i \le n - 1$$$, and from tree $$$n$$$, you move back to tree $$$1$$$. This process continues indefinitely as you move through the trees in a cycle.</p><p>However, you have a special condition: you may only eat an apple if its beauty is strictly greater than the beauty of the last apple you ate. For example, if $$$b = [2, 1, 2, 3]$$$ and you eat the apple on tree $$$1$$$ (beauty $$$2$$$), you cannot eat the apples on trees $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ because their beauties are not greater than $$$2$$$. However, you may eat the apple on tree $$$4$$$ since $$$b_4 = 3 > 2$$$.</p><p>Note that you are allowed to skip an apple when you first encounter it, and you can choose to eat it later on a subsequent cycle.</p><p>Your task is to determine the maximum number of apples you can eat if you make optimal decisions on when to eat or skip each apple.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.
