There are $$$n+1$$$ villages and $$$2n-1$$$ directed roads in this city. </p><p>There are two kinds of roads:</p><ul> <li> $$$n-1$$$ roads are from village $$$i$$$ to village $$$i+1$$$, for all $$$1\leq i \leq n-1$$$. </li><li> $$$n$$$ roads can be described by a sequence $$$a_1,\ldots,a_n$$$. If $$$a_i=0$$$, the $$$i$$$-th of these roads goes from village $$$i$$$ to village $$$n+1$$$, otherwise it goes from village $$$n+1$$$ to village $$$i$$$, for all $$$1\leq i\leq n$$$. </li></ul><p>Mocha plans to go hiking with Taki this weekend. To avoid the trip being boring, they plan to go through every village <span class="tex-font-style-bf">exactly once</span>. They can start and finish at any villages. Can you help them to draw up a plan? </p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. </p><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 20$$$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 10^4$$$) — indicates that the number of villages is $$$n+1$$$.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 1$$$). If $$$a_i=0$$$, it means that there is a road from village $$$i$$$ to village $$$n+1$$$. If $$$a_i=1$$$, it means that there is a road from village $$$n+1$$$ to village $$$i$$$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case, print a line with $$$n+1$$$ integers, where the $$$i$$$-th number is the $$$i$$$-th village they will go through.
